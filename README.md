# Encryption Folder

This folder contains the code and resources related to the encryption functionality of the project. Below is an overview of the folder's structure and its contents:

## `__pycache__` Directory

The `__pycache__` directory contains compiled Python files, which are automatically generated when the Python scripts are run. The compiled files in this directory correspond to the following Python scripts:

- `aes_cipher.py` - Contains functionality for AES encryption and decryption.
- `extract_text.py` - Handles text extraction from sensitive datasets.
- `qr_code_generator.py` - Generates QR codes for secure access.

## `templates` Directory

The `templates` directory contains HTML files used by the Flask application to provide user interfaces for key verification.

### `index.html`

This is the main HTML form where users can enter their generated key to gain access to sensitive data.
